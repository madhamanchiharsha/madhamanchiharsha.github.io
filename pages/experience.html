            <li>
                In my current role i am responsible for understanding the requirements right, mentor the buddies of the
                team, and make sure my deliverable are delivered on or before time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Apart from assigned work assigned, what i focused on is , How to improve the current process we follow in team, and also what could be the next best potential thing for the product.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I saw an improvement that can be achieved throught simple automation, Like basically we have good number of micor services,
                        the responsibility of some of microservices would be with my team, so I have created a script which would help team upfront about any blackduck issues, this will help tracking and prioritising issues in the same sprint which would help in smooth transition to 
                        QA to CQA and then to PROD environemnts.
                        with this being in place we improved our deliveries by prioritsing issues upfront. Basically <b>the script will send message to microsoft teams scrum channel with latest issues.</b>                
                    </li>
